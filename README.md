# Running  Functions Locally steps 

clone 
npm i 

npm run build-func

npm run func-serve

npm run shell


npm install --no-package-lock lodash 

This will install the lodash package in the root-level node_modules directory, rather than creating a new node_modules directory inside the my-lib library.

Keep in mind that using the --no-package-lock flag may cause issues with package versions and dependencies, as it prevents the package-lock.json file from being updated with the correct versions of installed packages. It is generally recommended to use the package-lock.json file to ensure consistent and reproducible dependencies across different environments
